## Browsing

The app supports search, browsing by title, and browsing by artwork. Once a game is selected it can be launched from your device. Games can also be marked as favorites.

## Metadata

https://github.com/tatsutron/rimokon/assets/51144928/7d232c99-1f83-45af-b0fd-014c1e850674

Metadata can be automatically imported for supported platforms. You can also edit the data by hand.

Rimokon can also use your camera to launch games via QR codes.

# Installation

Point your Android device [here](https://github.com/tatsutron/rimokon/releases/download/v1.0.0/rimokon_1.0.0.apk) to download and install the app. If the app is unable to find your MiSTer automatically, you will need to enter its IP address by hand.

# Limitations

* Cores and games are assumed to be in the places that they would be by default after formatting an SD card with [Mr. Fusion](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/mr-fusion).
* For importing metadata the app uses [OpenVGDB](https://github.com/OpenVGDB), which contains data for many (but not all) of the platforms supported by MiSTer.
